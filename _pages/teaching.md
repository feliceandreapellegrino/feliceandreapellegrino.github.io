    var num = Math.floor(Math.random() * 2); // 0...6
    //the second statement display the random image from the imagesArray array in the canvas image using the random number as the subscript value
    document.canvas.src = imagesArray[num];
}
//remember the subscript values of the array are 0 to 6 (seven elements) zero based array
//you will have to subtract 1 from the random number generated to account for the zero based array
displayImage();
