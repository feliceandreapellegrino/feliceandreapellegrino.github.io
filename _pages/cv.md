description: I was born in Conegliano (Italy) in 1974. I received the Laurea degree in Engineering from the University of Udine (Udine, Italy), in June 2000 and the Ph.D. degree from the same University in May 2005, discussing a thesis on Constrained and Optimal Control. I was Research Fellow at SISSA/ISAS (International School for Advanced Studies, Trieste) and University of Udine. I’m currently Associate Professor at Department of Engineering and Architecture, University of Trieste, where I teach the Control Theory and Computer Vision courses. I'm Senior member of IEEE. I served as Associate Editor of the IEEE Control Systems Letters and I'm member of the Conference Editorial Board of the IEEE Control Systems Society and of the European Control Association. My research interests include Control Theory, Machine Learning and Computer Vision. I have co-authored more than 70 research papers in archival journals, book chapters, and international conference proceedings and I’m the co-inventor of two patents. I have co-founded the company Glance Vision Technologies (GVT) Srl, a former spin–off company of SISSA/ISAS operating in the field of machine vision, with applications to industrial robotics and pharmacy automation.
