A <a href="https://pica.cineca.it/units/23ar1051-10fse/">two-year fellowship at University of Trieste</a>, focusing on Differentiable Rendering for Robotics, is now open for applications (deadline: December, 15 2023). The topic is an interdisciplinary one, at the intersection of Computer Vision, Optimization and Robotics (see the brief description below).<br>

    Single-camera pose estimation via differentiable rendering
</div>

<div>
Pose estimation consists of determining the position and orientation of an object with respect to a reference frame. Rendering consists of modelling the physical formation of an image, generating a synthetic image of an object that can be interpreted as a parametric function of its pose. A differentiable renderer, with a suitable optimization algorithm, can be used to estimate the pose by maximizing the similarity between the real and the synthetic image of an object. <strong>The research project aims to use a differentiable renderer for image-based control of a robot (visual servoing)</strong>. The idea is based on recent advances in optimization applied to artificial intelligence and aims to control the robot using feedback information from a camera placed on the robot itself. The research project has many significant applications, including smart manufacturing.
