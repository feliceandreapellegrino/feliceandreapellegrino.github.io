Pose estimation consists of determining the position and orientation of an object with respect to a reference frame. Rendering consists of modelling the physical formation of an image, generating a synthetic image of an object that can be interpreted as a parametric function of its pose. A differentiable renderer, with a suitable optimization algorithm, can be used to estimate the pose by maximizing the similarity between the real and the synthetic image of an object. The research project aims to use a differentiable renderer for image-based control of a robot (visual servoing). The idea is based on recent advances in optimization applied to artificial intelligence and aims to control the robot using feedback information from a camera placed on the robot itself. The research project has many significant applications to smart manufacturing.
