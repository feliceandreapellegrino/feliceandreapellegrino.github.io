abstract = {We show how the recent works on data-driven open-loop minimum-energy control for linear systems can be exploited to obtain closed-loop control laws in the form of linear dynamic controllers that are relatively optimal. Besides being stabilizing, they achieve the optimal minimum-energy trajectory when the initial condition is the same as the open-loop optimal control problem. The order of the controller is N−n, where N is the length of the optimal open-loop trajectory, and n is the order of the system. The same idea can be used for obtaining a relatively optimal controller, entirely based on data, from open-loop trajectories starting from up to n linearly independent initial conditions.}

abstract = {EXplainable AI (XAI) techniques can be employed to help identify points of concern in the objects analyzed when using image-based Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). There has been an increasing number of works proposing the usage of DNNs to perform Failure Analysis (FA) in various industrial applications. These DNNs support practitioners by providing an initial screening to speed up the manual FA process. In this work, we offer a proof-of-concept for using a DNN to recognize failures in pictures of Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), using the boolean information of (non) faultiness as ground truth. To understand if the model correctly identifies faulty connectors within the PCBs, we make use of XAI tools based on Class Activation Mapping (CAM), observing that the output of these techniques seems not to align well with these connectors. We further analyze the faithfulness of these techniques with respect to the DNN, observing that often they do not seem to capture relevant features according to the model's decision process. Finally, we mask out faulty connectors from the original images, noticing that the DNN predictions do not change significantly, thus showing that the model possibly did not learn to base its predictions on features associated with actual failures. We conclude with a warning that FA using DNNs should be conducted using more complex techniques, such as object detection, and that XAI tools should not be taken as oracles, but their correctness should be further analyzed.},

abstract = {In Late-Medieval panel paintings from the Tuscan area, mechanical tools called punches were used to impress repeated motifs on gold foils to create decorative patterns. Such patterns can be used as clues to objectively support the attribution of the paintings, as proposed by art historian Erling S. Skaug in his decades-long study on punches. We investigate the feasibility of employing automatic pattern recognition techniques for accelerating the process of classification of punches by experts working in the field. We propose a system composed of (a) a Convolutional Neural Network for categorizing a punch contained in a frame, and (b) an additional component for uncertainty estimation, aimed at recognizing possible Out-of-Distribution (OOD) samples. After collecting a set of 3815 punches from four 14th century panel paintings from Tuscany, we train a Convolutional Neural Network which achieves very high test-set accuracy. As far as the uncertainty estimation is concerned, we experiment with two techniques, OpenGAN and II-loss, both exhibiting very positive results. The former seems to work better on specific data extracted from images of panel paintings, while the latter showcases a more consistent behavior when considering additional OOD data obtained randomly. These outcomes indicate that an application of our system in support of experts is feasible, although we subsequently show that additional experiments on larger datasets might be required.},

abstract = {Most collaborative robots (cobots) can be taught by hand guiding: essentially, by manually jogging the robot, an operator teaches some configurations to be employed as via points. Based on those via points, Cartesian end-effector trajectories such as straight lines, circular arcs or splines are then constructed. Such methods can, in principle, be employed for cart-mounted cobots (i.e., when the jogging involves one or two linear axes, besides the cobot axes). However, in some applications, the sole imposition of via points in Cartesian space is not sufficient. On the contrary, albeit the overall system is redundant, (i)the via points must be reached at the taught joint configurations, and (ii)the undesirable singularity (and near-singularity) conditions must be avoided. The naive approach, consisting of setting the cart trajectory beforehand (for instance, by imposing a linear-in-time motion law that crosses the taught cart configurations), satisfies the first need, but does not guarantee the satisfaction of the second. Here, we propose an approach consisting of (i) a novel strategy for decoupling the planning of the cart trajectory and that of the robot joints, and (ii) a novel variational technique for computing the former in a singularity-aware fashion, ensuring the avoidance of a class of workspace singularity and near-singularity configurations.},

Pruning and quantization are well-known compression techniques that can potentially lead to a reduction of the computational burden of a DL model, with a possible decrease of performance in terms of detection accuracy. Motivated by the widespread introduction of face mask mandates by many institutions during the Covid-19 pandemic, we aim at training and compressing an OD model based on YOLOv4 to recognize the presence of face masks, to be deployed on a Raspberry Pi 4. We investigate the capability of different kinds of pruning and quantization techniques of increasing the FPS with respect to the uncompressed model, while retaining the detection accuracy. We quantitatively assess the pruned and quantized models in terms of Mean Average Precision (mAP) and FPS, and show that with proper pruning and quantization, the FPS can be doubled with a moderate loss in mAP. The results provide guidelines for compression of other OD models based on YOLO.},

abstract = {Biomonitoring plays a crucial role in the assessment of air quality, as it allows to estimate the presence of pollutants, by measuring deviations from normality of the components of an ecosystem. Lichens are among the organisms most commonly used as bioindicators. The present study deals with the classification of lichen taxa from images, by means of a machine learning process based on patch classification. A given image is divided in non-overlapping patches, and each of them undergoes feature extraction and classification, eventually being associated to a category. Three different methods for extracting patch descriptors are investigated: (i) handcrafted descriptors based on classical feature extractor algorithms, (ii) convolutional neural networks employed as feature extractors, and (iii) scattering networks, which combine wavelet convolutions and nonlinear operators. For each of these methods, the descriptors are used as inputs for a classification algorithm. The whole process is evaluated in terms of classification accuracy, empirically determining the most appropriate parameters for the different models implemented. By using the dataset of lichens of this study, best results (∼ 0.89 accuracy) are obtained with a specific handcrafted descriptor (dense SIFT), thus providing insights on the kind of representation which is most suitable for the task.},

abstract = {Artificial neural networks (ANNs) can be employed as controllers for robotic agents. Their structure is often com- plex, with many neurons and connections, especially when the robots have many sensors and actuators distributed across their bodies and/or when high expressive power is desirable. Pruning (removing neurons or connections) reduces the complexity of the ANN, thus increasing its energy efficiency, and has been reported to improve the gen- eralization capability, in some cases. In addition, it is well-known that pruning in biological neural networks plays a fundamental role in the development of brains and their ability to learn. In this study, we consider the evolutionary optimization of neural controllers for the case study ofVoxel-based soft robots, a kind of modular, bio-inspired soft robots, applying pruning during fitness evaluation. For a locomotion task, and for centralized as well as distributed controllers, we experimentally characterize the effect of different forms of pruning on after-pruning effectiveness, life-long effectiveness, adaptability to new terrains, and behavior. We find that incorporating some forms of pruning in neuroevolution leads to almost equally effective controllers as those evolved without pruning, with the benefit of higher robustness to pruning. We also observe occasional improvements in generalization ability.},

Deep learning techniques can be effective tools for such estimation from relatively poor measurements, but their computational demands must be carefully considered, for the actual deployment. In this work, we employ one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory networks to infer the status of some electrical components of different models of washing machines, from the electrical signals measured at the plug. These tools are trained and tested on a large dataset (502 washing cycles) collected from four different washing machines and are carefully designed in order to comply with the memory constraints imposed by available hardware selected for a real implementation. The approach is end-to-end; i.e., it does not require any feature extraction, except the harmonic decomposition of the electrical signals, and thus it can be easily generalized to other appliances.},

However, the trial and error intrinsic nature of RL may result in long training time on real robots and, moreover, it may lead to dangerous outcomes. While simulators are useful tools to accelerate RL training and to ensure safety, they often are provided only with an approximated model of robot dynamics and of its interaction with the surrounding environment, thus resulting in what is called the reality gap (RG): a mismatch of simulated and real control-law performances caused by the inaccurate representation of the real environment in simulation. The most undesirable result occurs when the controller learnt in simulation fails the task on the real robot, thus resulting in an unsuccessful sim-to-real transfer. The goal of the present survey is threefold: (1) to identify the main approaches to face the RG problem in the context of robot control with RL, (2) to point out their shortcomings, and (3) to outline new potential research areas.},

This has urged the scientific world to investigate methods for the simplification of the structure of weights in ANNs, mainly in an effort to reduce time for both training and inference. Frankle and Carbin [1], and later Renda, Frankle, and Carbin [2] introduced and refined an iterative pruning method which is able to effectively prune the network of a great portion of its parameters with little to no loss in performance. On the downside, this method requires a large amount of time for its application, since, for each iteration, the network has to be trained for (almost) the same amount of epochs of the unpruned network. In this work, we show that, for a limited setting, if targeting high overall sparsity rates, this time can be effectively reduced for each iteration, save for the last one, by more than 50%, while yielding a final product (i.e., final pruned network) whose performance is comparable to the ANN obtained using the existing method.},

The current lack of explainability of their inner workings and of principled ways to tame their architectural complexity triggered a lot of research in recent years. There is hope that, by making sense of representations in their hidden layers, we could collect insights on how to reduce model complexity---without performance degradation---by pruning useless connections. It is natural then to ask the following question: how similar are representations in pruned and unpruned models? Even small insights could help in finding principled ways to design good lightweight models, enabling significant savings of computation, memory, time and energy. In this work, we investigate empirically this problem on a wide spectrum of similarity measures, network architectures and datasets. We find that the results depend critically on the similarity measure used and we discuss briefly the origin of these differences, concluding that further investigations are required in order to make substantial advances.},

For instance, in wire sawing, a translation along the wire axis is permitted. Such an admissible displacement can be thought of as an additional degree of freedom that could be exploited for accomplishing further tasks, e.g., collision avoidance. In the case of offline programming, the operator can manually adapt the trajectory in order to exploit such additional degree of freedom. However, when the tool trajectory is automatically generated, as in modern flexible automation systems, an automatic way to adjust the displacement is needed. We propose an approach that, based on virtual redundancy (introduced originally for singularity avoidance purposes) and barrier functions, can automatically exploit the additional degree of freedom while satisfying the constraints on the admissible displacement.},

In this extended version of our previous work, we present a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) for the AP in which the meal is treated as a disturbance to be estimated by an Unknown Input Observer (UIO). The MPC constraints are expressed in terms of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications. Indeed, in the AP some requirements result in hard constraints (in particular, absolutely avoid hypoglycemia and absolutely avoid severe hyperglycemia) and some other in soft constraints (avoid a prolonged hyperglycemia) and STL is suitable for expressing such requirements. The achieved results are obtained using the BluSTL toolbox, which allows to synthesize model predictive controllers with STL constraints. We report simulations showing that the proposed approach, avoiding unnecessary restrictions, provides safe trajectories in correspondence of higher unknown disturbance.},

abstract = {Optimal tuning of particle accelerators is a challenging task. Many different approaches have been proposed in the past to solve two main problems—attainment of an optimal working point and performance recovery after machine drifts. The most classical model-free techniques (e.g., Gradient Ascent or Extremum Seeking algorithms) have some intrinsic limitations. To overcome those limitations, Machine Learning tools, in particular Reinforcement Learning (RL), are attracting more and more attention in the particle accelerator community. We investigate the feasibility of RL model-free approaches to align the seed laser, as well as other service lasers, at FERMI, the free-electron laser facility at Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste. We apply two different techniques—the first, based on the episodic Q-learning with linear function approximation, for performance optimization; the second, based on the continuous Natural Policy Gradient REINFORCE algorithm, for performance recovery. Despite the simplicity of these approaches, we report satisfactory preliminary results, that represent the first step toward a new fully automatic procedure for the alignment of the seed laser to the electron beam. Such an alignment is, at present, performed manually.},

In order to ensure a suitable level of maintenance, manufacturers strive to design a method to estimate the wear of the single electrical parts composing an appliance without providing it with a large number of expensive sensors. With this in mind, our goal consists in inferring the status of the electrical actuators of a washing machine, given the measures of electrical signals at the plug, which carry an aggregate information. The approach is end-to-end, i.e. it does not require any feature extraction and thus it can be easily generalized to other appliances. Two different techniques have been investigated: Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memories. These tools are trained and tested on data collected on four different washing machines.},

Our method includes a preprocessing phase that allows to learn a U-net despite the scarcity of labeled data, which reflects the peculiarity of the task, in which manual annotation is, in general, costly. We experimentally evaluate our method and compare it against the few other methods for mosaic images segmen- tation using a set of performance indexes, previously proposed for this task, computed using 11 images of real mosaics. In our results, U-net compares favorably with previous methods. Interestingly, the considered meth- ods make errors of different kinds, consistently with the fact that they are based on different assumptions and techniques. This finding suggests that combining different approaches might lead to an even more effective segmentation.},

abstract = {During the last few decades, artificial neural networks (ANN) have achieved an enormous success in regres- sion and classification tasks. The empirical success has not been matched with an equally strong theoretical understanding of such models, as some of their working principles (training dynamics, generalization proper- ties, and the structure of inner representations) still remain largely unknown. It is, for example, particularly difficult to reconcile the well known fact that ANNs achieve remarkable levels of generalization also in con- ditions of severe over-parametrization. In our work, we explore a recent network compression technique, called Iterative Magnitude Pruning (IMP), and apply it to convolutional neural networks (CNN). The pruned and unpruned models are compared layer-wise with Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). Our results show a high similarity between layers of pruned and unpruned CNNs in the first convolutional layers and in the fully-connected layer, while for the intermediate convolutional layers the similarity is significantly lower. This suggests that, although in intermediate layers representation in pruned and unpruned networks is markedly different, in the last part the fully-connected layers act as pivots, producing not only similar performances but also similar representations of the data, despite the large difference in the number of parameters involved.},

Thus this method is well suited for modeling unknown, possibly complex relationships, that may not be captured by simple handcrafted models.

Patients with this disease inject insulin to regulate the level of glucose in the blood, thus reducing the risk of longterm complications. Artificial Pancreas (AP) is a wearable device developed to provide automatic delivery of insuline, allowing a potentially significant improvement in the quality of life of patients. In this paper we apply to the AP a Model Predictive Controller able to generate state trajectories that meet constraints expressed through Signal Temporal Logic (STL). Such a form of constraints is indeed appropriate for the AP, in which some requirements result in hard constraints (absolutely avoid hypoglycaemia) and some other in soft constraints (avoid a prolonged hyperglycaemia). We rely on the BluSTL toolbox, which allows to automatically generate controllers using STL specifications. We perform simulations on two different scenarios: an MPC controller that uses the same constraints as [1] and an MPC-STL controller in both deterministic and adversarial environment (robust control). We show that the soft constraints permitted by STL avoid unnecessary restriction, providing safe trajectories in correspondence of higher disturbance.},

@article{Cucit2018,
abstract = {Cavitation is a well-known phenomenon that may occur, among other turbo-machines, in centrifugal pumps and can result in severe damage of both the pump and the whole hydraulic system. There are situations in which, in principle, the cavitation could be avoided by detecting the condition of incipient cavitation, and changing slightly the working point of the whole system in order to move away from that condition. In the present paper two simple closed-loop control strategies are implemented, acting on the pump's rotational speed and fed by the measurements of a set of inertial sensors. In particular, the research is focused on a centrifugal pump normally employed in hydraulic systems. The pump operates in a dedicated test rig, where cavitation can be induced by acting on a reservoir's pressure. Three accelerometers are installed in the pump body along three orthogonal axes. An extensive set of experiments has been carried out at different flow rates and a number of signals' features both in the time domain and in the frequency domain have been considered as indicators of incipient cavitation. The amount of energy of the signal captured by the accelerometer in the component orthogonal to the flow direction, in the band from 10 to 12.8 kHz, demonstrated to be effective in detecting the incipient cavitation, by selecting a proper (condition-dependent) threshold. Therefore, two simple controllers have been designed: the first regulates the speed of the pump, to recover from cavitation, bringing the indicator back to the nominal value, while the second allows to reduce the pump's rotational speed when the cavitation detector indicates the incipient cavitation and restoring the nominal speed when possible. The latter approach is rather general, because the threshold-based detector can be substituted by any detector providing binary output. Experimental results are reported that demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.},

The suggested tuning scheme may fail in the presence of parasitic dynamics, which may destabilize the loop if the tuning action is too aggressive. Here we show that such tuning action can be applied to dynamic plants as well if it is sufficiently “slow”, a property that we can ensure by limiting the integral action. We provide robust bounds based on the exclusive knowledge of the largest time constant and of the matrix polytope to which the system Jacobian is known to belong. We also provide similar bounds in the presence of parasitic dynamics affecting the actuators.},

abstract = {The radiation generated by a seeded free-electron laser (FEL) is characterized by a high temporal coherence, which is close to the Fourier limit in the ideal case. The setup and optimization of a FEL is a non-trivial and challenging operation. This is due to the plethora of highly sensitive machine parameters and to the complex correlations between them. The fine tuning of the FEL process is normally supervised by physicists and is carried out by scanning various parameters with the aim of optimizing the spectrum of the emitted pulses in terms of intensity and line-width. In this article we introduce a novel quantitative method for the evaluation of the FEL spectrum via a quality index.

By using a ground-truth consisting of a set of manually annotated mosaics, we objectively compare the performance of some existing recent segmentation methods, based on a simple error metric taking into account precision, recall and the error on the number of tiles. Moreover, we introduce some mosaic-specific hardness estimators (namely some indexes of how difficult is the task of segmenting a particular mosaic image). The results show that the only segmentation algorithm specifically designed for mosaics performs better than the general purpose algorithms. However, the problem of segmentation of mosaics appears still partially unresolved and further work is needed for exploiting the specificity of mosaics in designing new segmentation algorithms.},

abstract = {This paper presents a continuous time solution to the problem of designing a relatively optimal control, precisely, a dynamic control which is optimal with respect to a given initial condition and is stabilizing for any other initial state. This technique provides a drastic reduction of the complexity of the controller and successfully applies to systems in which (constrained) optimality is necessary for some “nominal operation” only. The technique is combined with a pole assignment procedure. It is shown that once the closed-loop poles have been fixed and an optimal trajectory originating from the nominal initial state compatible with these poles is computed, a stabilizing compensator which drives the system along this trajectory can be derived in closed form. There is no restriction on the optimality criterion and the constraints. The optimization is carried out over a finite-dimensional parameterization of the trajectories. The technique has been presented for state feedback. We propose here a technique based on the Youla–Ku{\v{c}}era parameterization which works for output feedback. The main result is that we provide conditions for solvability in terms of a set of linear algebraic equations.},

Indeed, the visual performance of implanted lenses has a deep impact on the life of the subjects, having medical, social and economical consequences. The purpose of the present paper is twofold: first, we propose an experimental setup, consisting of an actuated opto–electro– mechanical eye capable of simulating different refractive and optical conditions. Second, we suggest to employ some well– known image quality assessment tools for evaluating the visual performance of different IOLs (or of the same IOL in different conditions) based on the comparison between the original image and that produced by the artificial eye equipped with the IOL. The objective and repeatable results obtained, are in accor- dance with subjective evaluation (a time–consuming procedure employed in previous works).},

Obtaining an offline approximation of the receding horizon control law may lead to a very significant reduction of the online computational burden with respect to algorithms based on iterated optimization, thus allowing the application to fast dynamics plants. The proposed approximation scheme allows to cope with discontinuous control laws, such as those arising from constrained nonlinear finite horizon optimal control problems. A detailed stability analysis of the closed-loop system driven by the approximated state-feedback controller shows that the devised technique guarantees the input-to-state practical stability with respect to the (non-fading) approximation-induced errors. Two examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the method when the approximator is chosen either as a discontinuous nearest point function or as a smooth neural network.},

An experimental opto-electronic test bench has been realized following the Gullstrand eye model and ISO 11979-2 norm. The system includes an electro-opto-mechanical device that simulates the optical and geometric characteristics of the human eye. The PMMA artificial cornea has been realized with optical and geometric properties similar to those of a real cornea. A cylindrical lens is placed in front of the artificial cornea to simulate corneal astigmatism. Toric IOL were analized evaluating the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) and the quality of different images. A relevant software was realized to capture, store images and evaluate their quality in accordance with established criteria. Images transmitted through an astigmatic cornea are corrected by the toric IOL as much as the axis of the lens correspond to the axis of the astigmatism thus improving the transmission of different spatial frequencies and the quality of test images. Pupil diameter affects the quality of images especially when a residual refractive error is induced. This opto-electronic test bench allows to determine the quality of images transmitted by premium intraocular lenses in different refractive and optical conditions. Toric IOL have been studied demonstrating their ability to correct the corneal astigmatism. This system allows to evaluate different criteria besides the MTF, such as the evaluation of sharpness or the distortion of local image patterns or even to formulate new objective image evaluating criteria.},

This methodology can be used either in an unsupervised fashion, or on-line, classifying new trajectories or part of them; it is able to manage different length and noisy trajectories, occlusions and takes velocity profiles and stops into account. We extend our previous work by taking into account other features besides the spatial locations, in particular the direction of movement in correspondence of each trajectory point. We discuss the simulation results and we compare our approach with another trajectory clustering method.},

abstract = {Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are an established tool for pattern recognition. However, their application to real–time object detection (such as detection of objects in each frame of a video stream) is limited due to the relatively high computational cost. Speed is indeed crucial in such applications. Motivated by a practical problem (hand detection), we show how second–degree polynomial SVMs in their primal formulation, along with a recursive elimination of monomial features and a cascade architecture can lead to a fast and accurate classifier. For the considered hand detection problem we obtain a speed–up factor of 1600 with comparable classification performance with respect to a single, unreduced SVM.},

The idea is to investigate how the approximation errors affect the stability of the closed-loop system, in order to derive suitable bounds which have to be fulfilled by the approximating function. This analysis allows to conveniently set up the characteristic parameters of some techniques such as Neural Networks which can be used to implement the control law, in order to render the system Input-to-State Practically Stable while satisfying, in addition, hard constraints on the trajectories; both the amount of data storage and the computational time result strongly reduced with respect to Nearest Neighbor or Set Membership approaches, which have been recently proposed to obtain effective off-line approximation of nonlinear MPC.

The main feature of the proposed approximation scheme consists in the possibility to cope with possibly discontinuous state-feedback control laws, while guaranteeing the fulfillment of hard constraints on state and input variables despite the perturbations due to the use of an approximate controller.

abstract = {The paper deals with the problem of positioning a manipulator in a cluttered environment while avoiding collision with obstacles. Recently a control strategy based on invariant sets has been introduced by some of the authors: it consists of covering the configuration space by means of a connected family of poly- hedral regions which can be rendered controlled-invariant. Each of these regions includes some crossing points to the confining (and partially overlapping) regions. The control is hierarchically structured: a high-level controller establishes a proper sequence of regions to be crossed to reach the one in which the target con- figuration is included. A low-level controller solves the problem of tracking, within a region, the crossing point to the next con- fining region and, eventually, tracking the reference whenever it is included in the current one. Here we focus on the low-level controller, providing two novel contributions: first we extend the previous results, based on a vertex representation of the polyhedral sets, to the face representation which is more natural and offers significant computational advantages for on-line implementation; second, we provide a new low-level speed-saturated controller in order to improve the performance of the previous one in terms of convergence speed. We also investigate the robustness of the proposed controller. Experimental results on a Cartesian robot are provided.},

In this paper, we prove that a relatively optimal control can be ob- tained under quite general constraints and objective function, in particular without imposing 0-terminal constraints as previously done. The main result is that stability of the closed-loop system can be achieved by assigning an arbitrary closed-loop character- istic stable polynomial to the plant. An explicit solution is provided. We also show how to choose the characteristic polynomial in such a way that the constraints (which are enforced on a finite horizon) can be globally or ultimately satisfied (i.e., satisfied from a certain time on). We provide conditions to achieve strong stabilization (sta- bilization by means of a stable compensator) precisely, we show how to assign both compensator and closed-loop poles. We consider the output feedback problem, and we show that it can be success- fully solved by means of a proper observer initialization (based on output measurements only). We discuss several applications of the technique and provide experimental results on a cart-pendulum system.},

abstract = {Constraint fulfillment and optimality are two important aspects of most real–world con- trol problems. Constraints typically arise from safety, physical or performance limita- tions and must be taken into account in the design stage, especially in those cases when constraint violation may have serious consequences. As a matter of fact, the control of systems subject to input or state constraints is a difficult task, being the problem in- herently nonlinear. The problem becomes still harder if optimality is also pursued. The most popular approaches to optimality for linear systems (namely LQR, LQG, H∞, L1) do not take into account constraints. The more general tools of dynamic programming and Pontryagin minimum principle are not useful in most cases, the former involving an- alytical and numerical difficulties, the latter being suitable for open–loop solutions only. The receding horizon approach allows for dealing with constraints in a suboptimal (and sometimes optimal) way but it requires solving on–line an optimization problem at each time step. In this thesis we review some of the basic techniques for constrained optimal control focusing our attention to those that are the most effective from a computational point of view. We also present an original contribution, namely the relatively optimal control (ROC) that is a stabilizing feedback control, synthesized starting from a given (or a set of given) open–loop optimal trajectories, that guarantees optimality for a given (or a set of given) initial conditions. The ROC is based on relaxing the requirement of obtaining a controller that is optimal for all possible initial conditions; on the contrary, we require optimality only from some initial conditions that are of interest for the con- sidered system. For linear systems, we provide a linear dynamic as well as a piecewise affine static solution and we develop various extensions of the basic idea.},

abstract = {The paper considers a novel technique for manip- ulator motion in constrained environment due to the presence of obstacles. The basic problem is that of avoiding collisions of the manipulator with the obstacles. The main idea is to cover the free space (i.e. the points of the configurations space in which no collisions are possible) by a connected family of polyhedral sets which are controlled–invariant. Each of these polyhedral regions includes some crossing points to the confining regions. The tracking control is hierarchically struc- tured. A high–level controller establishes a connected chain of regions to be crossed to reach the one in which the reference is included. A low–level control solves the problem of tracking, within a region, the crossing point to the next confining region and, eventually, tracking the reference whenever it is included in the current one. The scheme assures that the reference is asymptotically tracked and that the transient trajectory is completely included in the admissible configuration space. A connection graph associated with the cluster of regions, and the high–level control is achieved by solving a minimum–path problem. As far as the low–level control is concerned, we consider both speed–control and torque–control. We propose two types of controllers. The first type is based on a linear stabilizing feedback which is suitably adapted to achieve a local tracking controller. Such a controller is computed by the plane representation of the sets which is more natural and useful then the vertex representation considered in previous work. The second is a speed–saturated type of controller which considerably improves the performance of linear–based control laws. Both these controllers have a speed–control and torque–control version. Experimental results on a laboratory Cartesian robot are provided.},

abstract = {Often an image g(x,y) is regularized and even restored by minimizing the Mumford-Shah functional. Properties of the regularized image u(x,y) depends critically on the numerical value of the two parameters alpha and gamma controlling smoothness and fidelity. When alpha and gamma are constant over the image, small details are lost when an extensive filtering is used in order to remove noise. In this paper, it is shown how the two parameters alpha and gamma can be made self-adaptive. In fact, alpha and gamma are not constant but automatically adapt to the local scale and contrast of features in the image. In this way, edges at all scales are detected and boundaries are well-localized and preserved. In order to preserve trihedral junctions alpha and gamma become locally small and the regularized image u(x,y) maintains sharp and well-defined trihedral junctions. Images regularized by the proposed procedure are well-suited for further processing, such as image segmentation and object recognition.},

abstract = {This paper describes a vision-based system that is able to automatically recognize deformable objects, to estimate their pose, and to select suitable picking points. A hierarchical self-organized neural network is used to segment color images based on texture information. A morphological analysis allows the recognition of the objects and the picking points extraction. The proposed approach is useful in all of the situations where texture properties are significant for detecting regions of interest on deformable objects. Several tests on a large number of images, acquired in real operative working conditions, demonstrate the effectiveness of the system.},

abstract = {The present manuscript aims at solving four problems of edge detection: the simultaneous detection of all step edges from a fine to a coarse scale; the detection of thin bars with a width of very few pixels; the detection of trihedral junctions; the development of an algorithm with image-independent parameters. The proposed solution of these problems combines an extensive spatial filtering with classical methods of computer vision and newly developed algorithms. Step edges are computed by extracting local maxima from the energy summed over a large bank of directional odd filters with a different scale. Thin roof edges are computed by considering maxima of the energy summed over narrow odd and even filters along the direction providing maximal response. Junctions are precisely detected and recovered using the output of directional filters. The proposed algorithm has a threshold for the minimum contrast of detected edges: for the large number of tested images this threshold was fixed equal to three times the standard deviation of the noise present in usual acquisition system (estimated to be between 1 and 1.3 gray levels out of 256), therefore, the proposed scheme is in fact parameter free. This scheme for edge detection performs better than the classical Canny edge detector in two quantitative comparisons: the recovery of the original image from the edge map and the structure from motion task. As the Canny detector in previous comparisons was shown to be the best or among the best detectors, the proposed scheme represents a significant improvement over previous approaches.},

abstract = {We propose a new technique for controlling manipulators in constrained environments. Based on recent developments on constrained control theory, our approach basically consists in covering the admissible region of the configuration space by partially overlapping convex polyhedra arbitrarily fixed and forming a connected family. Each of these polyhedra, defined in the configuration space, is suitably extended in the state-space (i.e. configuration-plus-velocity space) in order to maintain all the original connections among regions and to be a tracking domain of attraction for the system, i.e. a set of initial states from which a reference signal can be asymptotically approached without constraints violation during the transient. The connection path is not generated a priori, but it is automatically produced on-line by a hierarchical feedback controller. A high-level controller selects the confining polyhedron, to which the current state has to be transferred, which is the closest to the one containing the target reference. A low-level controller solves the problem of locally tracking a suitable crossing point to the desired new region under constraints. The robustness of the scheme as well as the control effort constraints are also taken into account.},

abstract = {A relatively optimal control is a stabilizing controller such that, if initialized at its zero state, produces the optimal (constrained) behavior for the nominal initial condition of the plant (without feedforwarding and tracking the optimal trajectory). In a previous work we have shown that one of such controllers is linear, dead-beat, and its order is equal to the length of the horizon minus the plant order, thus of complexity which is known a-priori. In this work we remove the assumption of zero terminal state and we show how to assign an arbitrary closed-loop characteristic stable polynomial to the plant (an explicit solution is provided.) We also show how to choose the characteristic polynomial in such a way that the constraints (which are enforced on a finite horizon) can be globally or ultimately satisfied.},

abstract = {Solving a continuous-time optimal control problem under state and control constraints is known to be a very hard task. In this note, we propose a suboptimal solution based on the Euler auxiliary system (EAS). We show that we can determine a continuous-time stabilizing control whose cost not only converges to the optimal as the EAS time parameter vanishes, but it is also upper bounded by the discrete-time cost, no matter how such a parameter is chosen. In particular, continuous-time linear problems with convex cost can be solved by considering a fictitious receding-horizon scheme. Both stability and constraints satisfaction are guaranteed for the continuous-time system. This scheme turns out to be very useful when, due to unstable or poorly damped dynamics, the digital implementation of the control requires a very small (virtually zero) sampling time, since the “time parameter” of the EAS can be much greater than the sampling time, without compromising stability, with a strongly reduced computational burden.},
