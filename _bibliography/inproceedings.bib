  abstract = {We show how the recent works on data driven open-loop minimum-energy control for linear systems can be exploited to obtain closed-loop piecewise-affine control laws, by employing a state-space partitioning technique which is at the basis of the static relatively optimal control. In addition, we propose a way for employing portions of the experimental input and state trajectories to recover information about the natural movement of the state and dealing with non-zero initial conditions. The same idea can be used for formulating several open-loop control problems entirely based on data, possibly including input and state constraints.},

  abstract = {Deploying Deep Learning (DL) based object detection (OD) models in low-end devices, such as single board computers, may lead to poor performance in terms of frames-per-second (FPS). Pruning and quantization are well-known compression techniques that can potentially lead to a reduction of the computational burden of a DL model, with a possible decrease of performance in terms of detection accuracy. Motivated by the widespread introduction of face mask mandates by many institutions during the Covid-19 pandemic, we aim at training and compressing an OD model based on YOLOv4 to recognize the presence of face masks, to be deployed on a Raspberry Pi 4. We investigate the capability of different kinds of pruning and quantization techniques of increasing the FPS with respect to the uncompressed model, while retaining the detection accuracy. We quantitatively assess the pruned and quantized models in terms of Mean Average Precision (mAP) and FPS, and show that with proper pruning and quantization, the FPS can be doubled with a moderate loss in mAP. The results provide guidelines for compression of other OD models based on YOLO.},

  abstract = {Simulation is a powerful tool used to train Re- inforcement Learning (RL) agents involved in robotic tasks. It allows to collect large amount of data in comparatively faster and safer way than on the real robot. However, a simulator is only an approximation of the physical system to be controlled. Due to modeling errors, a controller learned on the simulator dynamics may behave differently once applied to the real robot. In the worst case, the controller, although being successful when applied on the simulator, may fail when applied on the real platform. In this paper, we deal with the sim-to-real transfer of a RL controller for a Poppy Ergo-Jr robotic arm involved in a positioning task: i.e., moving the servo joints in order to reach a desired target position with the end-effector. In particular, we want to investigate the differences between the real robot and its simulator and how they affect the controller performance after its transfer from the simulator to the real platform.},

  abstract = {In recent years, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) pruning has become the focal point of many researches, due to the extreme overparametrization of such models. This has urged the scientific world to investigate methods for the simplification of the structure of weights in ANNs, mainly in an effort to reduce time for both training and inference. Frankle and Carbin [1], and later Renda, Frankle, and Carbin [2] introduced and refined an iterative pruning method which is able to effectively prune the network of a great portion of its parameters with little to no loss in performance. On the downside, this method requires a large amount of time for its application, since, for each iteration, the network has to be trained for (almost) the same amount of epochs of the unpruned network. In this work, we show that, for a limited setting, if targeting high overall sparsity rates, this time can be effectively reduced for each iteration, save for the last one, by more than 50%, while yielding a final product (i.e., final pruned network) whose performance is comparable to the ANN obtained using the existing method.},

  abstract = {Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are commonly used for controlling robotic agents. For robots with many sensors and actuators, ANNs can be very complex, with many neurons and connections. Removal of neurons or connections, i.e., pruning, may be desirable because (a) it reduces the complexity of the ANN, making its operation more energy efficient, and (b) it might improve the generalization ability of the ANN. Whether these goals can actually be achieved in practice is however still not well known. On the other hand, it is widely recognized that pruning in biological neural networks plays a fundamental role in the development of brains and their ability to learn. In this work, we consider the case of Voxel-based Soft Robots, a kind of robots where sensors and actuators are distributed over the body and that can be controlled with ANNs optimized by means of neuroevolution. We experimentally characterize the effect of different forms of pruning on the effectiveness of neuroevolution, also in terms of generalization ability of the evolved ANNs. We find that, with some forms of pruning, a large portion of the connections can be pruned without strongly affecting robot capabilities. We also observe sporadic improvements in generalization ability.},

  abstract = {In some robotic manufacturing processes, a displacement between the nominal tool trajectory and the actual can be tolerated, provided that the displacement occurs along a specific direction/rotation axis. For instance, in wire sawing, a translation along the wire axis is permitted. Such an admissible displacement can be thought of as an additional degree of freedom that could be exploited for accomplishing further tasks, e.g., collision avoidance. In the case of offline programming, the operator can manually adapt the trajectory in order to exploit such additional degree of freedom. However, when the tool trajectory is automatically generated, as in modern flexible automation systems, an automatic way to adjust the displacement is needed. We propose an approach that, based on virtual redundancy (introduced originally for singularity avoidance purposes) and barrier functions, can automatically exploit the additional degree of freedom while satisfying the constraints on the admissible displacement.},

In order to ensure a suitable level of maintenance, manufacturers strive to design a method to estimate the wear of the single electrical parts composing an appliance without providing it with a large number of expensive sensors. With this in mind, our goal consists in inferring the status of the electrical actuators of a washing machine, given the measures of electrical signals at the plug, which carry an aggregate information. The approach is end-to-end, i.e. it does not require any feature extraction and thus it can be easily generalized to other appliances. Two different techniques have been investigated: Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memories. These tools are trained and tested on data collected on four different washing machines.},

We propose to use a recent deep learning technique based on a kind of convolutional neural networks, called U-net, that proved to be effective in seg- mentation tasks. Our method includes a preprocessing phase that allows to learn a U-net despite the scarcity of labeled data, which reflects the peculiarity of the task, in which manual annotation is, in general, costly. We experimentally evaluate our method and compare it against the few other methods for mosaic images segmen- tation using a set of performance indexes, previously proposed for this task, computed using 11 images of real mosaics. In our results, U-net compares favorably with previous methods. Interestingly, the considered meth- ods make errors of different kinds, consistently with the fact that they are based on different assumptions and techniques. This finding suggests that combining different approaches might lead to an even more effective segmentation.},

  abstract = {During the last few decades, artificial neural networks (ANN) have achieved an enormous success in regres- sion and classification tasks. The empirical success has not been matched with an equally strong theoretical understanding of such models, as some of their working principles (training dynamics, generalization proper- ties, and the structure of inner representations) still remain largely unknown. It is, for example, particularly difficult to reconcile the well known fact that ANNs achieve remarkable levels of generalization also in con- ditions of severe over-parametrization. In our work, we explore a recent network compression technique, called Iterative Magnitude Pruning (IMP), and apply it to convolutional neural networks (CNN). The pruned and unpruned models are compared layer-wise with Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). Our results show a high similarity between layers of pruned and unpruned CNNs in the first convolutional layers and in the fully-connected layer, while for the intermediate convolutional layers the similarity is significantly lower. This suggests that, although in intermediate layers representation in pruned and unpruned networks is markedly different, in the last part the fully-connected layers act as pivots, producing not only similar performances but also similar representations of the data, despite the large difference in the number of parameters involved.},

  abstract = {The optimization of particle accelerators is a challenging task, and many different approaches have been proposed in years, to obtain an optimal tuning of the plant and to keep it optimally tuned despite drifts or disturbances. Indeed, the classical model-free approaches (such as Gradient Ascent or Extremum Seeking algorithms) have intrinsic limitations. To overcome those limitations, Machine Learning techniques, in particular, the Reinforcement Learning, are attracting more and more attention in the particle accelerator community. The purpose of this paper is to apply a Reinforcement Learning model-free approach to the alignment of a seed laser, based on a rather general target function depending on the laser trajectory. The study focuses on the alignment of the lasers at FERMI, the free-electron laser facility at Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste. In particular, we employ Q-learning with linear function approximation and report experimental results obtained in two setups, which are the actual setups where the final application has to be deployed. Despite the simplicity of the approach, we report satisfactory preliminary results, that represent the first step toward a fully automatic procedure for seed laser to the electron beam. Such a superimposition is, at present, performed manually.},

  abstract = {Machine learning techniques have been widely applied to production processes with the aim of improving product quality, supporting decision-making, or implementing process diagnostics. These techniques proved particularly useful in manufacturing industry where huge variety of heterogeneous data, related to different production processes, can be gathered and recorded but where traditional models fail due to the complexity of the production process. In this study, we describe a novel Machine Learning methodology to associate some product attributes (either defects or desirable qualities) to process parameters. Namely we combined Support Vector Ma- chine (SVM) and the Support Vector Representation Machine (SVRM) for instance ranking. The combination of SVM and SVRM guarantees a high flexibility in modeling the decision surfaces (thanks to the kernels) while containing overfitting (thanks to the principle of margin maximization). Thus this method is well suited for modeling unknown, possibly complex relationships, that may not be captured by simple handcrafted models. We applied our method to production data of an investment casting industry placed in South Italy. We obtain an instance ranking that may be used to infer proper values of process parameter set-points.},

Patients with this disease inject insulin to regulate the level of glucose in the blood, thus reducing the risk of longterm complications. Artificial Pancreas (AP) is a wearable device developed to provide automatic delivery of insuline, allowing a potentially significant improvement in the quality of life of patients. In this paper we apply to the AP a Model Predictive Controller able to generate state trajectories that meet constraints expressed through Signal Temporal Logic (STL). Such a form of constraints is indeed appropriate for the AP, in which some requirements result in hard constraints (absolutely avoid hypoglycaemia) and some other in soft constraints (avoid a prolonged hyperglycaemia). We rely on the BluSTL toolbox, which allows to automatically generate controllers using STL specifications. We perform simulations on two different scenarios: an MPC controller that uses the same constraints as [1] and an MPC-STL controller in both deterministic and adversarial environment (robust control). We show that the soft constraints permitted by STL avoid unnecessary restriction, providing safe trajectories in correspondence of higher disturbance.},

The suggested tuning scheme may fail in the presence of parasitic dynamics, which may destabilize the loop if the tuning action is too aggressive. Here we show that such tuning action can be applied to dynamic plants as well if it is sufficiently “slow”, a property that we can ensure by limiting the integral action. We provide robust bounds based on the exclusive knowledge of the largest time constant and of the matrix polytope to which the system Jacobian is known to belong. We also provide similar bounds in the presence of parasitic dynamics affecting the actuators.},

In this paper we prove that, if the polytope is robustly non-singular (or has full row rank, in the general non-square case), then a suitable discrete-time tuning law drives the output to the desired point. The computation of the tuning law is based on a convex-optimisation problem to be solved on-line. An application example is proposed to show the effectiveness of the approach.},

Such an activity is usually based on manual procedures which are typically lengthy and costly. Digital imaging technologies have a great potential in this important application domain, from a number of points of view including smaller costs and much broader functionalities. In this work, we propose a mosaic-oriented image segmentation algorithm aimed at identifying automatically the tiles composing a mosaic based solely on an image of the mosaic itself. Our proposal consists of a Genetic Algorithm, in which we represent each candidate segmentation with a set of quadrangles whose shapes and positions are modified during an evolutionary search based on multi-objective optimization. We evaluate our proposal in detail on a set of real mosaics which differ in age and style. The results are highly promising and in line with the current state-of-the-art.},

This is an important step, for instance, for preserving ancient mosaics. By using a ground-truth consisting of a set of manually annotated mosaics, we objectively compare the performance of some existing recent segmentation methods, based on a simple error metric taking into account precision, recall and the error on the number of tiles. Moreover, we introduce some mosaic-specific hardness estimators (namely some indexes of how difficult is the task of segmenting a particular mosaic image). The results show that the only segmentation algorithm specifically designed for mosaics performs better than the general purpose algorithms. However, the problem of segmentation of mosaics appears still partially unresolved and further work is needed for exploiting the specificity of mosaics in designing new segmentation algorithms.},

Such a problem can be solved in an efficient way and may be easily modified to include constraints due to obstacles. Here we present further developments of the idea. In particular, for the case of planar robots, we show (i) how to impose hard constraints on the joint angles while preserving the convexity of the problem, and (ii) how to add constraints due to objects (for instance, a load carried by the robot) that are rigidly attached to some part of the robot.},

Indeed, the visual performance of implanted lenses has a deep impact on the life of the subjects, having medical, social and economical consequences. The purpose of the present paper is twofold: first, we propose an experimental setup, consisting of an actuated opto–electro– mechanical eye capable of simulating different refractive and optical conditions. Second, we suggest to employ some well– known image quality assessment tools for evaluating the visual performance of different IOLs (or of the same IOL in different conditions) based on the comparison between the original image and that produced by the artificial eye equipped with the IOL. The objective and repeatable results obtained, are in accor- dance with subjective evaluation (a time–consuming procedure employed in previous works).},

An experimental opto-electronic test bench has been realized following the Gullstrand eye model and ISO 11979-2 norm. The system includes an electro-opto-mechanical device that simulates the optical and geometric characteristics of the human eye. The PMMA artificial cornea has been realized with optical and geometric properties similar to those of a real cornea. A cylindrical lens is placed in front of the artificial cornea to simulate corneal astigmatism. Toric IOL were analized evaluating the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) and the quality of different images. A relevant software was realized to capture, store images and evaluate their quality in accordance with established criteria. Images transmitted through an astigmatic cornea are corrected by the toric IOL as much as the axis of the lens correspond to the axis of the astigmatism thus improving the transmission of different spatial frequencies and the quality of test images. Pupil diameter affects the quality of images especially when a residual refractive error is induced. This opto-electronic test bench allows to determine the quality of images transmitted by premium intraocular lenses in different refractive and optical conditions. Toric IOL have been studied demonstrating their ability to correct the corneal astigmatism. This system allows to evaluate different criteria besides the MTF, such as the evaluation of sharpness or the distortion of local image patterns or even to formulate new objective image evaluating criteria.},

The main feature of the proposed approximation scheme consists in the possibility to cope with possibly discontinuous state-feedback control laws, while guaranteeing the fulfillment of hard constraints on state and input variables despite the perturbations due to the use of an approximate controller.

Given a control Lyapunov function, the main idea is that of tuning the feedback gain according to a suitably–chosen Lyapunov time–derivative. The control gain is not monotonically non–decreasing as in existing techniques, but it is increased or decreased depending on the imposed derivative, thus avoiding the well-known issue of actuator over– exploitation. We are able to show robust convergence of the proposed adaptive control scheme as well as other interesting properties. For instance, it is possible to guarantee an a–priori given upper bound for the transient mode of behavior during adaptation. Furthermore, if the control Lyapunov function is designed based on an optimal control problem, then the control action is nominally optimal, precisely it yields the optimal trajectory for any initial condition, if the actual plant matches the nominal system.},

It is also shown how to obtain a controller that is not dead–beat by removing the zero terminal constraint while guaranteeing stability. Finally, the proposed static compensator is compared with the dynamic one.},

  abstract = {The paper considers a novel technique for manip- ulator motion in constrained environment due to the presence of obstacles. The basic problem is that of avoiding collisions of the manipulator with the obstacles. The main idea is to cover the free space (i.e. the points of the configurations space in which no collisions are possible) by a connected family of polyhedral sets which are controlled–invariant. Each of these polyhedral regions includes some crossing points to the confining regions. The tracking control is hierarchically struc- tured. A high–level controller establishes a connected chain of regions to be crossed to reach the one in which the reference is included. A low–level control solves the problem of tracking, within a region, the crossing point to the next confining region and, eventually, tracking the reference whenever it is included in the current one. The scheme assures that the reference is asymptotically tracked and that the transient trajectory is completely included in the admissible configuration space. A connection graph associated with the cluster of regions, and the high–level control is achieved by solving a minimum–path problem. As far as the low–level control is concerned, we consider both speed–control and torque–control. We propose two types of controllers. The first type is based on a linear stabilizing feedback which is suitably adapted to achieve a local tracking controller. Such a controller is computed by the plane representation of the sets which is more natural and useful then the vertex representation considered in previous work. The second is a speed–saturated type of controller which considerably improves the performance of linear–based control laws. Both these controllers have a speed–control and torque–control version. Experimental results on a laboratory Cartesian robot are provided.},

  abstract = {A relatively optimal control is a stabilizing controller such that, if initialized at its zero state, produces the optimal (constrained) behavior for the nominal initial condition of the plant (without feedforwarding and tracking the optimal trajectory). In a previous work we have shown that one of such controllers is linear, dead-beat, and its order is equal to the length of the horizon minus the plant order, thus of complexity which is known a-priori. In this work we remove the assumption of zero terminal state and we show how to assign an arbitrary closed-loop characteristic stable polynomial to the plant (an explicit solution is provided.) We also show how to choose the characteristic polynomial in such a way that the constraints (which are enforced on a finite horizon) can be globally or ultimately satisfied.},

  abstract = {Motivated by the fact that determining a feedback solution for the optimal control problem under constraints is a hard task we introduce the concept of relative optimality, roughly optimality for a specific (nominal) plant initial condition. We consider a generic discrete-time finite-horizon constrained optimal control problem for linear systems, and we seek for a state feedback (possibly dynamic) controller. As a fundamental requirement, we do not admit preactions or controller-state initialization based on the plant initial state and we assume our controller to be time-invariant. In particular, we do not consider controllers simply achieved by the feedforward and tracking of the optimal trajectory. A relatively optimal control is a stabilizing controller such that, if initialized at its zero state, produces the optimal (constrained) trajectory for the nominal initial condition of the plant. We show that one of such controllers is linear, dead- beat, and its order is equal to the length of the horizon minus the plant order, thus of complexity which is known a-priori.},

It is shown that as long as the Euler Approximating System (EAS) of a given continuous–time plant admits a positive definite convex suboptimal value function, it is possibile to determine a stabilizing control for the continuous–time system whose cost not only converges to the optimal, but it is also upper bounded by the discrete–time cost no matter how the “discretization time parameter” is chosen.},

@inproceedings{Pellegrino2002,
  abstract = {The present manuscript aims to address and possibly solve three classical problems of edge detection: i – the detection of all step edges from a fine to a coarse scale; ii – the detection of thin bars, i.e. of roof edges; iii – the detection of corners and trihedral junctions. The proposed solution of these problems combines an extensive spatial filtering, inspired by the receptive field properties of neurons in the visual area V1, with classical methods of Computer Vision (Morrone & Burr 1988; Lindeberg 1998; Kovesi 1999) and newly developed algorithms. Step edges are computed by extracting local maxima from the energy summed over a large bank of odd filters of different scale and direction. Thin roof edges are computed by considering maxima of the energy summed over narrow odd and even filters along the direction of maximal response. Junctions are precisely detected by an appropriate combination of the output of directional filters. Detected roof edges are cleaned by using a regularization procedure and are combined with step edges and junctions in a Mumford-Shah type functional with self adaptive parameters, providing a nearly ideal edge detection and segmentation.},
