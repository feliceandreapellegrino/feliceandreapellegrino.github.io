  abstract = {In Late-Medieval panel paintings from the Tuscan area, mechanical tools called punches were used to impress repeated motifs on gold foils to create decorative patterns. Such patterns can be used as clues to objectively support the attribution of the paintings, as proposed by art historian Erling S. Skaug in his decades-long study on punches. We investigate the feasibility of employing automatic pattern recognition techniques for accelerating the process of classification of punches by experts working in the field. We propose a system composed of (a) a Convolutional Neural Network for categorizing a punch contained in a frame, and (b) an additional component for uncertainty estimation, aimed at recognizing possible Out-of-Distribution (OOD) samples. After collecting a set of 3815 punches from four 14th century panel paintings from Tuscany, we train a Convolutional Neural Network which achieves very high test-set accuracy. As far as the uncertainty estimation is concerned, we experiment with two techniques, OpenGAN and II-loss, both exhibiting very positive results. The former seems to work better on specific data extracted from images of panel paintings, while the latter showcases a more consistent behavior when considering additional OOD data obtained randomly. These outcomes indicate that an application of our system in support of experts is feasible, although we subsequently show that additional experiments on larger datasets might be required},

@article{Salvato2022Robotics,
  abstract = {Most collaborative robots (cobots) can be taught by hand guiding: essentially, by manually jogging the robot, an operator teaches some configurations to be employed as via points. Based on those via points, Cartesian end-effector trajectories such as straight lines, circular arcs or splines are then constructed. Such methods can, in principle, be employed for cart-mounted cobots (i.e., when the jogging involves one or two linear axes, besides the cobot axes). However, in some applications, the sole imposition of via points in Cartesian space is not sufficient. On the contrary, albeit the overall system is redundant, (i)the via points must be reached at the taught joint configurations, and (ii)the undesirable singularity (and near-singularity) conditions must be avoided. The naive approach, consisting of setting the cart trajectory beforehand (for instance, by imposing a linear-in-time motion law that crosses the taught cart configurations), satisfies the first need, but does not guarantee the satisfaction of the second. Here, we propose an approach consisting of (i) a novel strategy for decoupling the planning of the cart trajectory and that of the robot joints, and (ii) a novel variational technique for computing the former in a singularity-aware fashion, ensuring the avoidance of a class of workspace singularity and near-singularity configurations.},

  abstract = {Biomonitoring plays a crucial role in the assessment of air quality, as it allows to estimate the presence of pollutants, by measuring deviations from normality of the components of an ecosystem. Lichens are among the organisms most commonly used as bioindicators. The present study deals with the classification of lichen taxa from images, by means of a machine learning process based on patch classification. A given image is divided in non-overlapping patches, and each of them undergoes feature extraction and classification, eventually being associated to a category. Three different methods for extracting patch descriptors are investigated: (i) handcrafted descriptors based on classical feature extractor algorithms, (ii) convolutional neural networks employed as feature extractors, and (iii) scattering networks, which combine wavelet convolutions and nonlinear operators. For each of these methods, the descriptors are used as inputs for a classification algorithm. The whole process is evaluated in terms of classification accuracy, empirically determining the most appropriate parameters for the different models implemented. By using the dataset of lichens of this study, best results (∼ 0.89 accuracy) are obtained with a specific handcrafted descriptor (dense SIFT), thus providing insights on the kind of representation which is most suitable for the task.},

  abstract = {Artificial neural networks (ANNs) can be employed as controllers for robotic agents. Their structure is often com- plex, with many neurons and connections, especially when the robots have many sensors and actuators distributed across their bodies and/or when high expressive power is desirable. Pruning (removing neurons or connections) reduces the complexity of the ANN, thus increasing its energy efficiency, and has been reported to improve the gen- eralization capability, in some cases. In addition, it is well-known that pruning in biological neural networks plays a fundamental role in the development of brains and their ability to learn. In this study, we consider the evolutionary optimization of neural controllers for the case study ofVoxel-based soft robots, a kind of modular, bio-inspired soft robots, applying pruning during fitness evaluation. For a locomotion task, and for centralized as well as distributed controllers, we experimentally characterize the effect of different forms of pruning on after-pruning effectiveness, life-long effectiveness, adaptability to new terrains, and behavior. We find that incorporating some forms of pruning in neuroevolution leads to almost equally effective controllers as those evolved without pruning, with the benefit of higher robustness to pruning. We also observe occasional improvements in generalization ability.},

  abstract = {Estimating the wear of the single electrical parts of a home appliance without resorting to a large number of sensors is desirable for ensuring a proper level of maintenance by the manufacturers. Deep learning techniques can be effective tools for such estimation from relatively poor measurements, but their computational demands must be carefully considered, for the actual deployment. In this work, we employ one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory networks to infer the status of some electrical components of different models of washing machines, from the electrical signals measured at the plug. These tools are trained and tested on a large dataset (502 washing cycles) collected from four different washing machines and are carefully designed in order to comply with the memory constraints imposed by available hardware selected for a real implementation. The approach is end-to-end; i.e., it does not require any feature extraction, except the harmonic decomposition of the electrical signals, and thus it can be easily generalized to other appliances.},

  abstract = {The growing demand for robots able to act autonomously in complex scenarios has widely accelerated the introduction of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in robots control applications. However, the trial and error intrinsic nature of RL may result in long training time on real robots and, moreover, it may lead to dangerous outcomes. While simulators are useful tools to accelerate RL training and to ensure safety, they often are provided only with an approximated model of robot dynamics and of its interaction with the surrounding environment, thus resulting in what is called the reality gap (RG): a mismatch of simulated and real control-law performances caused by the inaccurate representation of the real environment in simulation. The most undesirable result occurs when the controller learnt in simulation fails the task on the real robot, thus resulting in an unsuccessful sim-to-real transfer. The goal of the present survey is threefold: (1) to identify the main approaches to face the RG problem in the context of robot control with RL, (2) to point out their shortcomings, and (3) to outline new potential research areas.},

  abstract = {The attainment of a satisfactory operating point is one of the main problems in the tuning of particle accelerators. These are extremely complex facilities, characterized by the absence of a model that accurately describes their dynamics, and by an often persistent noise which, along with machine drifts, affects their behaviour in unpredictable ways. In this paper, we propose an online iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) approach to tackle this problem on the FERMI free-electron laser of Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste. It consists of a model identification performed by a neural network trained on data collected from the real facility, followed by the application of the iLQR in a Model-Predictive Control fashion. We perform several experiments, training the neural network with increasing amount of data, in order to understand what level of model accuracy is needed to accomplish the task. We empirically show that the online iLQR results, on average, in fewer steps than a simple gradient ascent (GA), and requires a less accurate neural network to achieve the goal.},

  abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are essential tools of modern science and technology. The current lack of explainability of their inner workings and of principled ways to tame their architectural complexity triggered a lot of research in recent years. There is hope that, by making sense of representations in their hidden layers, we could collect insights on how to reduce model complexity---without performance degradation---by pruning useless connections. It is natural then to ask the following question: how similar are representations in pruned and unpruned models? Even small insights could help in finding principled ways to design good lightweight models, enabling significant savings of computation, memory, time and energy. In this work, we investigate empirically this problem on a wide spectrum of similarity measures, network architectures and datasets. We find that the results depend critically on the similarity measure used and we discuss briefly the origin of these differences, concluding that further investigations are required in order to make substantial advances.},

  abstract = {The glycemia regulation is a significant challenge in the Artificial Pancreas (AP) scenario. Several control systems have been developed in the last years, many of them requiring meal announcements. Therefore, if the patients skip the meal announcement or make a mistake in the estimation of the amount of carbohydrates, the control performance will be negatively affected. In this extended version of our previous work, we present a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) for the AP in which the meal is treated as a disturbance to be estimated by an Unknown Input Observer (UIO). The MPC constraints are expressed in terms of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications. Indeed, in the AP some requirements result in hard constraints (in particular, absolutely avoid hypoglycemia and absolutely avoid severe hyperglycemia) and some other in soft constraints (avoid a prolonged hyperglycemia) and STL is suitable for expressing such requirements. The achieved results are obtained using the BluSTL toolbox, which allows to synthesize model predictive controllers with STL constraints. We report simulations showing that the proposed approach, avoiding unnecessary restrictions, provides safe trajectories in correspondence of higher unknown disturbance.},

  abstract = {Optimal tuning of particle accelerators is a challenging task. Many different approaches have been proposed in the past to solve two main problems—attainment of an optimal working point and performance recovery after machine drifts. The most classical model-free techniques (e.g., Gradient Ascent or Extremum Seeking algorithms) have some intrinsic limitations. To overcome those limitations, Machine Learning tools, in particular Reinforcement Learning (RL), are attracting more and more attention in the particle accelerator community. We investigate the feasibility of RL model-free approaches to align the seed laser, as well as other service lasers, at FERMI, the free-electron laser facility at Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste. We apply two different techniques—the first, based on the episodic Q-learning with linear function approximation, for performance optimization; the second, based on the continuous Natural Policy Gradient REINFORCE algorithm, for performance recovery. Despite the simplicity of these approaches, we report satisfactory preliminary results, that represent the first step toward a new fully automatic procedure for the alignment of the seed laser to the electron beam. Such an alignment is, at present, performed manually.},

@article{Cucit2018,
  abstract = {Cavitation is a well-known phenomenon that may occur, among other turbo-machines, in centrifugal pumps and can result in severe damage of both the pump and the whole hydraulic system. There are situations in which, in principle, the cavitation could be avoided by detecting the condition of incipient cavitation, and changing slightly the working point of the whole system in order to move away from that condition. In the present paper two simple closed-loop control strategies are implemented, acting on the pump's rotational speed and fed by the measurements of a set of inertial sensors. In particular, the research is focused on a centrifugal pump normally employed in hydraulic systems. The pump operates in a dedicated test rig, where cavitation can be induced by acting on a reservoir's pressure. Three accelerometers are installed in the pump body along three orthogonal axes. An extensive set of experiments has been carried out at different flow rates and a number of signals' features both in the time domain and in the frequency domain have been considered as indicators of incipient cavitation. The amount of energy of the signal captured by the accelerometer in the component orthogonal to the flow direction, in the band from 10 to 12.8 kHz, demonstrated to be effective in detecting the incipient cavitation, by selecting a proper (condition-dependent) threshold. Therefore, two simple controllers have been designed: the first regulates the speed of the pump, to recover from cavitation, bringing the indicator back to the nominal value, while the second allows to reduce the pump's rotational speed when the cavitation detector indicates the incipient cavitation and restoring the nominal speed when possible. The latter approach is rather general, because the threshold-based detector can be substituted by any detector providing binary output. Experimental results are reported that demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.},

It is shown that, if the polytope is robustly nonsingular (or has full rank, in the nonsquare case), then a suitable tuning scheme drives the output to the desired point. The proof exploits a Lyapunov-like function and applies a well-known game-theoretic result, concerning the existence of a saddle point for a min-max zero-sum game.

  abstract = {This paper presents a continuous time solution to the problem of designing a relatively optimal control, precisely, a dynamic control which is optimal with respect to a given initial condition and is stabilizing for any other initial state. This technique provides a drastic reduction of the complexity of the controller and successfully applies to systems in which (constrained) optimality is necessary for some “nominal operation” only. The technique is combined with a pole assignment procedure. It is shown that once the closed-loop poles have been fixed and an optimal trajectory originating from the nominal initial state compatible with these poles is computed, a stabilizing compensator which drives the system along this trajectory can be derived in closed form. There is no restriction on the optimality criterion and the constraints. The optimization is carried out over a finite-dimensional parameterization of the trajectories. The technique has been presented for state feedback. We propose here a technique based on the Youla–Ku{\v{c}}era parameterization which works for output feedback. The main result is that we provide conditions for solvability in terms of a set of linear algebraic equations.},

Obtaining an offline approximation of the receding horizon control law may lead to a very significant reduction of the online computational burden with respect to algorithms based on iterated optimization, thus allowing the application to fast dynamics plants. The proposed approximation scheme allows to cope with discontinuous control laws, such as those arising from constrained nonlinear finite horizon optimal control problems. A detailed stability analysis of the closed-loop system driven by the approximated state-feedback controller shows that the devised technique guarantees the input-to-state practical stability with respect to the (non-fading) approximation-induced errors. Two examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the method when the approximator is chosen either as a discontinuous nearest point function or as a smooth neural network.},

Given a control Lyapunov function, the main idea is that of tuning the feedback gain according to a suitably-chosen Lyapunov time-derivative. The control gain is not monotonically non-decreasing as in existing techniques, but it is increased or decreased depending on the imposed derivative, thus avoiding the well-known issue of actuator over-exploitation. We are able to show robust convergence of the proposed adaptive control scheme as well as other interesting properties. For instance, it is possible to guarantee an a-priori given upper bound for the transient mode of behavior during adaptation. Furthermore, if the control Lyapunov function is designed based on an optimal control problem, then the control action is nominally optimal, precisely it yields the optimal trajectory for any initial condition, if the actual plant matches the nominal system.},

  abstract = {The paper deals with the problem of positioning a manipulator in a cluttered environment while avoiding collision with obstacles. Recently a control strategy based on invariant sets has been introduced by some of the authors: it consists of covering the configuration space by means of a connected family of poly- hedral regions which can be rendered controlled-invariant. Each of these regions includes some crossing points to the confining (and partially overlapping) regions. The control is hierarchically structured: a high-level controller establishes a proper sequence of regions to be crossed to reach the one in which the target con- figuration is included. A low-level controller solves the problem of tracking, within a region, the crossing point to the next con- fining region and, eventually, tracking the reference whenever it is included in the current one. Here we focus on the low-level controller, providing two novel contributions: first we extend the previous results, based on a vertex representation of the polyhedral sets, to the face representation which is more natural and offers significant computational advantages for on-line implementation; second, we provide a new low-level speed-saturated controller in order to improve the performance of the previous one in terms of convergence speed. We also investigate the robustness of the proposed controller. Experimental results on a Cartesian robot are provided.},

The main result is that stability of the closed-loop system can be achieved by assigning an arbitrary closed-loop character- istic stable polynomial to the plant. An explicit solution is provided. We also show how to choose the characteristic polynomial in such a way that the constraints (which are enforced on a finite horizon) can be globally or ultimately satisfied (i.e., satisfied from a certain time on). We provide conditions to achieve strong stabilization (sta- bilization by means of a stable compensator) precisely, we show how to assign both compensator and closed-loop poles.

Properties of the regularized image u(x,y) depends critically on the numerical value of the two parameters alpha and gamma controlling smoothness and fidelity. When alpha and gamma are constant over the image, small details are lost when an extensive filtering is used in order to remove noise. In this paper, it is shown how the two parameters alpha and gamma can be made self-adaptive. In fact, alpha and gamma are not constant but automatically adapt to the local scale and contrast of features in the image. In this way, edges at all scales are detected and boundaries are well-localized and preserved. In order to preserve trihedral junctions alpha and gamma become locally small and the regularized image u(x,y) maintains sharp and well-defined trihedral junctions. Images regularized by the proposed procedure are well-suited for further processing, such as image segmentation and object recognition.},

  abstract = {The present manuscript aims at solving four problems of edge detection: the simultaneous detection of all step edges from a fine to a coarse scale; the detection of thin bars with a width of very few pixels; the detection of trihedral junctions; the development of an algorithm with image-independent parameters. The proposed solution of these problems combines an extensive spatial filtering with classical methods of computer vision and newly developed algorithms. Step edges are computed by extracting local maxima from the energy summed over a large bank of directional odd filters with a different scale. Thin roof edges are computed by considering maxima of the energy summed over narrow odd and even filters along the direction providing maximal response. Junctions are precisely detected and recovered using the output of directional filters. The proposed algorithm has a threshold for the minimum contrast of detected edges: for the large number of tested images this threshold was fixed equal to three times the standard deviation of the noise present in usual acquisition system (estimated to be between 1 and 1.3 gray levels out of 256), therefore, the proposed scheme is in fact parameter free. This scheme for edge detection performs better than the classical Canny edge detector in two quantitative comparisons: the recovery of the original image from the edge map and the structure from motion task. As the Canny detector in previous comparisons was shown to be the best or among the best detectors, the proposed scheme represents a significant improvement over previous approaches.},

Based on recent developments on constrained control theory, our approach basically consists in covering the admissible region of the configuration space by partially overlapping convex polyhedra arbitrarily fixed and forming a connected family. Each of these polyhedra, defined in the configuration space, is suitably extended in the state-space (i.e. configuration-plus-velocity space) in order to maintain all the original connections among regions and to be a tracking domain of attraction for the system, i.e. a set of initial states from which a reference signal can be asymptotically approached without constraints violation during the transient. The connection path is not generated a priori, but it is automatically produced on-line by a hierarchical feedback controller. A high-level controller selects the confining polyhedron, to which the current state has to be transferred, which is the closest to the one containing the target reference. A low-level controller solves the problem of locally tracking a suitable crossing point to the desired new region under constraints. The robustness of the scheme as well as the control effort constraints are also taken into account.},

In this note, we propose a suboptimal solution based on the Euler auxiliary system (EAS). We show that we can determine a continuous-time stabilizing control whose cost not only converges to the optimal as the EAS time parameter vanishes, but it is also upper bounded by the discrete-time cost, no matter how such a parameter is chosen. In particular, continuous-time linear problems with convex cost can be solved by considering a fictitious receding-horizon scheme. Both stability and constraints satisfaction are guaranteed for the continuous-time system. This scheme turns out to be very useful when, due to unstable or poorly damped dynamics, the digital implementation of the control requires a very small (virtually zero) sampling time, since the “time parameter” of the EAS can be much greater than the sampling time, without compromising stability, with a strongly reduced computational burden.},

As a fundamental requirement, we do not admit preactions or controller-state initialization based on the plant initial state and we assume our controller to be time-invariant. In particular, we do not consider controllers simply achieved by the feedforward and tracking of the optimal trajectory. A relatively optimal control is a stabilizing controller such that, if initialized at its zero state, produces the optimal (constrained) trajectory for the nominal initial condition of the plant. We show that one of such controllers is linear, dead-beat, and its order is equal to the length of the horizon minus the plant order, thus, of complexity which is known a priori. Some additional features such as the assignment of the compensator poles to achieve strong stabilization are proposed.
